# Find My Spot Philly

"Find My Spot Philly uses income-based information about local neighborhoods to help renters and home-owners find the best areas to search for a new place to live.   By matching a site-visitor's income to match neighborhoods with a median income close to theirs, they are able to focus their search to neighborhoods they can afford, and find a new home that meets their budget and lifestyle."
